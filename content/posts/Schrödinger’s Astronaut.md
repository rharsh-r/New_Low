As the world around me got darker and darker, where even light were slaves, I opened my eyes only to question, "am I alive? Is this heaven, or is it hell?” I drifted around not knowing how much time had passed. It was as if each cell of my body was being pulled painlessly, I wasn't hungry. I wasn’t myself. 

I tried and tried harder only to see the void laugh at me. I am starting to lose myself. I am starting to become one with void. Will this be the way my story concludes? I haven’t even married yet. The last thing I remember is my spaceship being pulled by the blackhole of the dying Sun. I shouldn’t have done this but it's too late to regret. I am now just a corpse with a thought. 

-..  ..  . The static sound of the transmitter disturbed my long slumber. I was excited, I could relive, I had a second chance. This went on for a while. I couldn't understand, I started to lose hope but at last I could see a ray of light, I rejoiced, I saw hands trying to pick me up, I saw faces concerned at me, I was finally happy at last. Or so I thought. 

I have grown older, achieved all I ever dreamt of, married the girl I loved most. I never struggled again, my life was perfect, a little too perfect, it felt different.  I don't know what is real, what is not, Am I still in the void. Did I ever come out of it or is it my brain creating memories to cope with loneliness? I don’t need anything, I need answers. I want to trust again. I want the real me back. 

Fantasies are awesome only when you are the reader not the protagonist. It was nothing but a deal with the devil. 

In the end, the only way to go forward is to be delusional just like how every person in the old world was, hoping for a better pay, a better day. Nothing perfect but still perfectly balanced. I will forever miss that.

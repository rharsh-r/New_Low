  <div class="post-content"><p>Decades has passed since World War III concluded, a war that only lasted a week but was enough to turn all partakers into dust, now the population is just a mere fraction of what it used to be, war commanded blood and so the slaughter of soldiers started by the mandatory drafts imposed on by the governments on men for frontline and women for support, resulting in eradication all adult men and time dissipated all old men.</p>
<p>The war was a result of the old grumpy powerful men in-charge to look after world peace couldn&rsquo;t hold their ego and the world was tolerant enough to let it slide, now the entirety has to suffer the consequences and the after effects.</p>
<p>War has changed the policies by which the world was governed. All the corrupt powerful are replaced by prosperous leaders, the world saw a speedy recovery, as the new leaders marched the commons moved alongside them giving rise to a new order, an order led by women for a new peaceful world that the predecessor failed at, the world finally seemed at rest. For the first time in human history, crimes were at near nil there was hope, hope for a future with peace and joy.</p>
<p>War has turned the tables. In this era women are the absolute pinnacle of human achievements and only they can have a man reserved for them. Men scarce enough that it seemed right to protect, even if it meant locking, chaining and enslaving them. They are what women were seen as once a tool to reproduce and repopulate, a property and servant that serves only the master that are expected to look after the house-chores, and objects for the powerful to exploit and use as their will. Their ambitions and dreams are of no one’s concern other than their bodies.</p>
<p>Power corrupts or is it that their true nature is revealed no matter what, the truth is that we are greedy and sinners; ethics and philosophies are human-made after all.</p>
<p>Women held the reins of political power, authoritative positions, leading governments, businesses, and military forces. The women in power are now venturing into an unknown territory and absolute control over everything. Food stockpiles were adequate to cure hunger after war but if ignored it will result in famine, rather than food, humans will be stockpiling dead-bodies.</p>
<p>As the mighty nukes destroyed the land necessary for the livelihood of commons, leaders started looking into ways of feeding the commons but couldn’t find any, and so the history repeats in order to distract the commons from the problems and to preserve their luxurious life, one has to initiate a war, and so it begins a new era with women being in the frontline to acquire food and men.</p>
<p>Young lads that grew to be fine men knowing nothing of past as being locked in houses all the time to preserve their chastity can only wonder with the other men around their age, ‘Will the world be ever at peace, can we ever get freedom go out without a guardian with all the privilege?’, looking at each other for an answer only to get a long silence, with all men, children, and old women hiding in basement of rundown mayor house, when all their ladies in war to protect the thing they love and live for. History is truly written by the blood of the fallen.</p>
<p>This is always true for the world that doesn’t learn from the past. A new wave of men that were fortunate enough to learn the past have emerged demanding equal rights and sharing of the resources to eliminate wars and preserve the human race from the misery of war only to get burned and skinned alive by the women in-charge who perceived them as a threat.</p>
<p>With newfound protests, anti-war sentiment and peace slogan echoing through-out the land it was a new era of change and equality.</p>
<p>“All Humans Are Equal”</p>
<p>Eventually the protests are successful enough to give the people basic rights and better lives. With the world navigating through such tough times with little hopes of equality and prosperity.</p>
<p>Women working in machinery industries while men in clothing industries to help get a liveable life they dreamed of, it really gives the impression of a peaceful world.</p>
<p>The scars will eventually be healed by time, the barren radioactive land will eventually be usable again, the world will eventually be populated again, are the thoughts looming in the mind of a man who dared to go against the women in power, as he is being hanged publicly with walls on either side with words he read as his last breathe dissipated closing his eyes for good.</p>
<p>“All Humans Are Equal but Some Humans Are More Equal Than Others”</p>

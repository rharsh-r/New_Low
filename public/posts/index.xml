      <description>As the world around me got darker and darker, where even light were slaves, I opened my eyes only to question, &amp;ldquo;am I alive? Is this heaven, or is it hell?” I drifted around not knowing how much time had passed. It was as if each cell of my body was being pulled painlessly, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t hungry. I wasn’t myself.
I tried and tried harder only to see the void laugh at me.</description>

      <description>Decades has passed since World War III concluded, a war that only lasted a week but was enough to turn all partakers into dust, now the population is just a mere fraction of what it used to be, war commanded blood and so the slaughter of soldiers started by the mandatory drafts imposed on by the governments on men for frontline and women for support, resulting in eradication all adult men and time dissipated all old men.</description>
